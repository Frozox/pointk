functionality for PHP classes.

        private $bar;
    }

<<<<<<< HEAD
Annotations aren't implemented in PHP itself which is why
this component offers a way to use the PHP doc-blocks as a
place for the well known annotation syntax using the
``@`` char.

Annotations in Doctrine are used for the ORM
configuration to build the class mapping, but it can
be used in other projects for other purposes too.

Installation
============

You can install the Annotation component with composer:

.. code-block::

 Â   $ composer require doctrine/annotations

Create an annotation class
==========================

<<<<<<< HEAD
An annotation class is a representation of the later
used annotation configuration in classes. The annotation
class of the previous example looks like this:

Reading annotations
===================

The access to the annotations happens by reflection of the class
containing them. There are multiple reader-classes implementing the
<<<<<<< HEAD
``Doctrine\Common\Annotations\Reader`` interface, that can
access the annotations of a class. A common one is

``Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationReader``:

.. code-block:: php

<<<<<<< HEAD

    use Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationReader;
    use Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationRegistry;

    // Deprecated and will be removed in 2.0 but currently needed
    AnnotationRegistry::registerLoader('class_exists');

>>>>>>> ThomasN
    $reflectionClass = new ReflectionClass(Foo::class);
    $property = $reflectionClass->getProperty('bar');

    $reader = new AnnotationReader();
<<<<<<< HEAD
    $myAnnotation = $reader->getPropertyAnnotation($property, 'bar');

    echo $myAnnotation->myProperty; // result: "value"

A reader has multiple methods to access the annotations
of a class.
=======
    $myAnnotation = $reader->getPropertyAnnotation($property, MyAnnotation::class);

    echo $myAnnotation->myProperty; // result: "value"

Note that ``AnnotationRegistry::registerLoader('class_exists')`` only works
if you already have an autoloader configured (i.e. composer autoloader).
Otherwise, :ref:`please take a look to the other annotation autoload mechanisms <annotations>`.

A reader has multiple methods to access the annotations of a class.

IDE Support
-----------

Some IDEs already provide support for annotations:

- Eclipse via the `Symfony2 Plugin <http://symfony.dubture.com/>`_
- PHPStorm via the `PHP Annotations Plugin <http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7320>`_ or the `Symfony2 Plugin <http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7219>`_
